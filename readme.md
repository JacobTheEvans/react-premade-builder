<h3>React/Redux/ES6 Builder</h3>
<p>This project was made to allow easy building of a React app without getting to deep into the tooling.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>1. On download run 'npm install' in terminal</p>
<p>2. Write your React code in /src with your main render method in app.js</p>
<p>3. Open a terminal and run 'node build.js'</p>
<p>4. Open the /public/index.html in your browser and checkout your React Website</p>
<p>*Note*</p>
<p>This project uses watchify so you can leave your build script running. If any changes occur the code will rebuild</p>
